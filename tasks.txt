Will have pomdoro timer 
can name pomdoros and assign pomdoros to diffrents tasks


also have a to do list 

ideallly can track time spent on certain parts of projects 


fix start button so it dosent reset you every time





tasks can be assigned to projects or single 


Project object containes tasks

taks contain name priortty diffuculty due-date date-created



UPdate 1 4-10 /////////
so i mean technically its working but like for whatever reason
the all the projects in the data are getting over ridden and its adding the tasks on 
instead of changing but the select project function is working want to get it so you 
select and see the tasks as well as display the rest of the inforamtion i have on file 

also need to figure out ID cause right now its fucked up and i think that may be part 
of the reaseaon why its wokring because everything is working off ID checking
and the createID() i have was a bandaid solution. Need to think how i want to do it though
because tasks might need to have unique ids in their own project folder and then 
get a new on if they move into a diffren project folder.Need to make IDs unique


also for some reason tasks are not staying in therre project folder.
need to only have things added to unassinged if no select option was selected or 
perhaps i might have a unassinged select option so it can go in their that way 
i can make it buzz if nothing is selected rather than having an error check 

once i get all that working it should be a breeze as on click will show you 
info on the project you clicked on and if you clcik on a task you get more specific info

also option to start pomodoro on whole project of on a single task that will be tallied 
on the task and project levels 

so that prob means removing pomdoro from starting UI ;
and also obvs tidying up the UI but rn its in working condition and it dosent look 
hidous so i can work with it untul i have it running

finally need to fix the fact that the init dosent run if there is nothing in task storage
always need to have current projects and tasks equal task storage. also need to make 
projects add to select on add and not on reload; prob just have a function make that 
select equal to data.projects on add 

add feature were people can be assingged diffrent tasks or take part in a task but only 
have like admin be able to assign people and complete projects but thats a strectch goal eople and complete projects but thats a strectch goal 


5/12

been quite a while need to find a way to complete task and have in save in storage
that way the green blue underline will work if its complete or not

5-16

Get pomodoro working and time tracking for tasks / projects
get kanban board going im thinking i can sort by the in progress thing but even so that is really implemented yet 
but yeah i can prob do something like if its x then put in this column prob like a for each with a case statement 
depending on the in progress 

while im at it i should be able to make a due soon view based on the due date 
lots of diffrent views based on a lot of diffren things like the priority level 

kanban thing has been started created a funciton that searches every task in every project and 
prints out based on progressright now all things have a progress level of zero si  i nceed to 
find a way to change that in the UI. Also I guess i can leve it how it is so it can kinda search all taska and maybe create a huge kanban boardbut i waant it to be specific to the current project you are wokring on idk 
i kind of need to decide what iw ant this to be bnecaus eat first it was a todo app but now its kind of 
a project management app and i think straddling the tow is confusing but for not i hacve the kanban up 
necuase i l;ike it and its eems like i shoule be able to iomplemtn
all i need is another funcitron  which prints out the kanbadn arrays into the board i have up 
tbnuh it shouldne be that hard i wasn treally putting in my best effort 
beacue i wsa kind of mad tired but that is off topic . Its coming along

main issues are stuff isnt updating in UI automatically as well as 
there is a issue in saving things in storage where it dosent always work 
and i dont think it is a the local storage level.

 i think the culprit is the findInData function becuase when it returns a fodler to mutate it is giving me 
 the folder in the projects part of the data structure not the current project or in local storage
 more investigation needed but now that i can pinpoint the issue i should be able to solve it 

basically clean up how data is added to storage both in project and in data storage
essentiaslly when something is updated in the current project/task make it equal to the same thing in the data structure 
and whenever the data structure is updated make it save to the local storage


def make that all one function so i dont have to keep repeating myself 

also prob going to make a fucntion that makes a user input UI so id ont have to do document create everytime

also going to need a function which get the current project and task ID's ive typed that out so much 
add users need to be saved but i have a rough outline for those functions even though buttons arnt linked in UI
as far as all the UI updates go need to make it so its only one at a time


got user add to project and task working need to hook up buttons on UI as well as add styling 

gonna try to work on adding users to a project and a task


5-24 Kanban work
sort by user 
add WIP Limit 
add subtasks?
horizontal swim lanes by user 
work on how items are stored not just a collection item 
add styling to actual board 


look over html naming conventions are ggetting a bit sloppy
same with event listenrs 


new stuff i used 
object.assign
array.find


porblems for git 


//get appennd delete ICON WORKING 

on users click i can get EITHEIR the users name or the ICOn to show up 
not both, not sure what is happening think they are going over each other 
ant that is causeing the icon to not show up 
LINE 241


// get other views to work once inside task view 
 Figure out how to make this REACT lol
  need to hide the task view and show this one
and then the inverse when back is clicked think im close with this visiblity but it would require me to restructure html
 LINE 203 tasks.js


// Fix data matching 
 IDK if this is a soulution but i will leave it how I had it 
  Issue is that for changeProgress in particular data is updating in current task but not current project 
  kanban is pulling from current project, so i dont know if i should make kanban ID match and then pull from 
main data or what b/c the currents are how most fumctions are centered around 
Object.assign(taskInCurrentProject,data.currentTask)

LINE 79 data.js

// kanban board
 for some reason its printging something twice and im sure it has to do with updateDAta()
    its wonky

    might make this with MVC pattern which would require another huge refractor but
    i can see its merits as on user action have it do a couple diffthing

    ui.showTask(task)
    data.save()
    yada yada think that will make it more testable and will make unit and intergration tests managable for me
    basically having one funciton run on an event and that function consist of smaller functions and those\
    smaller functions consist of even smaller functions will have to refreance calorie tracker app as its been months 

    since i tried to do it 

    like look at Kanbancommentclick and you will see a perfect reason why my fucntions are not reusable
    i should be able to have a simple commentTask function which takes in a taskID and a string and comments to that task
    and i would be able to call it from Kanbancommentclick but i cant since its doing a whole bunch of wonky stuff
